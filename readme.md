# These are just my personal custom presets for different themes.  
Load the theme you want by editing manifest.json to load the version you want (latest by default)  
So I decided to Deprecate Aroma-White due to instability issues and lag  
These are custom presets that I made from themes (which are linked)  
Do note that I don't really claim anything on these
